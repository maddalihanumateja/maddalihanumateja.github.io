I"%<p>I am a Ph.D student at the University of Maryland in the Department of Computer Science. My interests lie at the intersection of <strong>HCI</strong>, <strong><em>CSCW</em>, **Extended Reality (XR)</strong> and <strong>Accessibility</strong>. Specifically, as part of my research, I design, build, and study XR systems for remote collaboration and remote expert guidance in hobby settings (e.g. gardening). I am being advised by <a href="https://amandalazar.net/index.html">Dr. Amanda Lazar</a> of The Health, Aging, and Technology Lab, UMD.</p>
