I am the Principal Research Engineer for XR at ITI Systems and Headwall VR, Beltsville, MD. I graduated with a Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Maryland at College Park (UMD) and was advised by [Dr. Amanda Lazar](https://amandalazar.net/index.html) of The Health, Aging, and Technology Lab. My research work lies at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Computer Supported Collaborative Work**, and **Extended Reality (XR)** and has won **best paper awards** at ACM SIGCHI Conferences. Specifically, as part of my thesis work, I designed, built, and studied XR systems for remote collaboration and remote expert guidance in hobby settings (e.g. gardening) following **user-centered design** approaches and **mixed-methods** analyses. I have also been a part of various research and engineering projects that focus on technology for **accessibility**. You can find the related, Python, Web, Unity, Swift etc. code for research-related and other projects on my [github repo](https://github.com/maddalihanumateja). Some of the repos are private, so feel free to email me (hmaddali at umd dot edu) if interested in a particular project. You can also find links to related publications at the **ACM SIGCHI**, **CSCW**, and **ASSETS** conferences on my projects page. With [Headwall VR](https://headwallvr.com/), I've recently won the National Institute of Standards and Technology's [CommanDING Tech UI/UX challenge](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/04/nist-announces-winners-commanding-tech-challenge) to design next-gen incident command dashboards for first-responders.

Prior to joining UMD, I obtained my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech and have worked in various other research, engineering, and teaching roles that you can find on my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wR2xFS3tNuiXKw5_-WMaJNH0I3x8Bl4CRBp6c6IyIdU/edit).
