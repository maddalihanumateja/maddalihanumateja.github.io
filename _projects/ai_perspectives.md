img_alt: The Figure shows a story board with six panels. Panel 1 has Bob, an older adult with dementia who is in front of a laptop that he uses to pass his free time. Panel 2 describes him experiencing a foggy moment where things on his screen no longer make sense, Panel 3 describes that he is trying to work through the confusion but nothing he does seems to help. Panel 4 visualizes an AI on the laptop that recognizes Bob struggling with the content on the interface. In Panel 5, the AI adjusts the display to be more accessible in some way for his changing cognitive ability. Panel 6 shows that Bob is now able to continue using his device for entertainment even during his foggy moment.

I led a secondary thematic analysis of data from interviews with people living with dementia to discuss future directions for the design of AI-driven adaptive interfaces for supporting different types of memory.
