I've conducted participant observation (CHI'20) and user-centered design studies to understand how to design, build and evaluate systems that enhance the social and instructional experience of remote skill-sharing in expert-novice groups in skilled hobby activities (e.g. gardening, woodworking). Gardening is a useful case to explore design for collaboration in hobbies as it has widespread intergenerational appeal and is viewed as a meaningful activity for individuals, families and communities. For this project, I have built Networked Unity and AFRAME (WebXR) based design probes whose related GitHub repos can be accessed via request. Also, feel free to email me for more details on the to-be-published parts of this project.
