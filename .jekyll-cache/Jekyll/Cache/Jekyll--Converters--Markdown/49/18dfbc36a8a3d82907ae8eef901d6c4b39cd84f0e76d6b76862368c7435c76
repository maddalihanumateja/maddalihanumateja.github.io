I"§<p>I am a Ph.D student at the University of Maryland (UMD) in the Department of Computer Science and am being advised by <a href="https://amandalazar.net/index.html">Dr. Amanda Lazar</a> of The Health, Aging, and Technology Lab at UMD. My interests lie at the intersection of <strong>HCI</strong>, <strong>CSCW</strong>, <strong>Extended Reality (XR)</strong>, and <strong>Accessibility</strong>. Specifically, as part of my research, I design, build, and study XR systems for remote collaboration and remote expert guidance in hobby settings (e.g. gardening) following <strong>user-centered design</strong> approaches and <strong>mixed-methods</strong> analyses. You can find the related, Python, Web, Unity, Swift etc. code for research-related and other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/maddalihanumateja">github repo</a>. Some of the repos are private, so feel free to email me (hmaddali at umd dot edu) if interested in a particular project. You can also find links to related publications at the <strong>ACM SIGCHI</strong> and <strong>CSCW conferences</strong> on my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wR2xFS3tNuiXKw5_-WMaJNH0I3x8Bl4CRBp6c6IyIdU/edit">CV</a>.</p>
