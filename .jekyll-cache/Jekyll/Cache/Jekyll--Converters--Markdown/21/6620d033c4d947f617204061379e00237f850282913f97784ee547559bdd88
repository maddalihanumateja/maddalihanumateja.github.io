I"%<p>I am a Ph.D student at the University of Maryland (UMD) in the Department of Computer Science and am being advised by <a href="https://amandalazar.net/index.html">Dr. Amanda Lazar</a> of The Health, Aging, and Technology Lab at UMD. My interests lie at the intersection of <strong>HCI</strong>, <strong>CSCW</strong>, <strong>Extended Reality (XR)</strong>, and <strong>Accessibility</strong>. Specifically, as part of my research, I design, build, and study XR systems for remote collaboration and remote expert guidance in hobby settings (e.g. gardening) following a user-centered approach. You can find the related, Python, Web, Unity, Swift etc. code for research-related and other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/maddalihanumateja">github repo</a>. Some of the repos are private, so feel free to email me (hmaddali at umd dot edu) if interested in viewing these.</p>

<p>Note: This website is still under construction. This is my second public facing homepage. Instead of making it completely from scratch as in my <a href="https://maddalihanumateja.bitbucket.io">old homepage</a>, I’ve chosen to use the convenience of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I’ve tried recreating the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">minimal mistakes</a> theme using bootstrap.</p>
