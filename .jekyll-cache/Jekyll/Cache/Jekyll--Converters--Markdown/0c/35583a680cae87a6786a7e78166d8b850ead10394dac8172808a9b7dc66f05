I"-<p>I am a Ph.D student at the University of Maryland (UMD) in the Department of Computer Science and am being advised by <a href="https://amandalazar.net/index.html">Dr. Amanda Lazar</a> of The Health, Aging, and Technology Lab at UMD. My interests lie at the intersection of <strong>HCI</strong>, <strong><em>CSCW</em>, **Extended Reality (XR)</strong> and <strong>Accessibility</strong>. Specifically, as part of my research, I design, build, and study XR systems for remote collaboration and remote expert guidance in hobby settings (e.g. gardening) following a user-centered approach. You can find the related, Python, Web, Unity, Swift etc. code for research-related and other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/maddalihanumateja">github repo</a>. Some of the repos are private, so feel free to email me (hmaddali at umd dot edu).</p>

<p>This website is still under construction, so expect it to be bit buggy. This is my second public facing homepage. Instead of making it completely from scratch using basic HTML, JS, and CSS as in my <a href="maddalihanumateja.bitbucket.io">old homepage</a>, I’ve chosen to use the convenience of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I’ve tried recreating the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">minimal mistakes</a> theme using bootstrap.</p>
