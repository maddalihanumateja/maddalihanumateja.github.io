I've conducted participant observation (CHI'20) and user-centered design studies (CSCW '22) to understand how to design, build and evaluate systems that enhance the social and instructional experience of remote skill-sharing in expert-novice groups in skilled hobby activities (e.g. gardening, woodworking). Gardening is a useful case to explore design for collaboration in hobbies as it has widespread intergenerational appeal and is viewed as a meaningful activity for individuals, families and communities. For this project, I have built Networked Unity and AFRAME (WebXR) based design probes whose related GitHub repos can be accessed via request.
