I"Ý<p>I am a Ph.D student at the University of Maryland in the Department of Computer Science. My interests lie at the intersection of <strong>HCI</strong>, <strong><em>CSCW</em>, **Extended Reality (XR)</strong> and <strong>Accessibility</strong>. Specifically, as part of my research, I design, build, and study XR systems for remote collaboration and remote expert guidance in hobby settings (e.g. gardening) following a user-centered approach. I am being advised by <a href="https://amandalazar.net/index.html">Dr. Amanda Lazar</a> of The Health, Aging, and Technology Lab, UMD.</p>

<p>This is my second public facing homepage. Instead of making it completely from scratch using basic HTML, JS, and CSS as in my <a href="maddalihanumateja.bitbucket.io">old homepage</a>, Iâ€™ve chosen to use the convenience of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Iâ€™ve tried recreating the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">minimal mistakes</a> theme using bootstrap.</p>
