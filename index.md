I am a Ph.D student at the University of Maryland (UMD) in the Department of Computer Science and am being advised by [Dr. Amanda Lazar](https://amandalazar.net/index.html) of The Health, Aging, and Technology Lab at UMD. My interests lie at the intersection of **HCI**, **CSCW**, **Extended Reality (XR)**, and **Accessibility**. Specifically, as part of my research, I design, build, and study XR systems for remote collaboration and remote expert guidance in hobby settings (e.g. gardening) following a user-centered mixed-methods approach. You can find the related, Python, Web, Unity, Swift etc. code for research-related and other projects on my [github repo](https://github.com/maddalihanumateja). Some of the repos are private, so feel free to email me (hmaddali at umd dot edu) if interested in a particular project. You can also find links to related publications at the ACM SIGCHI and CSCW conferences on my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wR2xFS3tNuiXKw5_-WMaJNH0I3x8Bl4CRBp6c6IyIdU/edit).
